hacker_grid is a responsive theme for [Ghost](https:///ghost.org), based on [hacker_chic](https://github.com/hughrun/hacker_chic). It uses css `grid`, but falls back reasonably gracefully in browsers that are not `grid` compliant, like IE and Edge.

## Topics

Create a blank page called `Topics` and hacker_grid will automatically fill it with a list of tags your blog uses, sized according to how many posts use each tag.

## Aside

Using `<aside>` will give a nice pop-out effect.

## Footer

### Navigation

The Nav menu appears in the footer. Add nav items in the Ghost admin area.

### contact Info

This section will pick up your Twitter account from @blog info, but you'll need to manually adjust email, GitHub and eanything else you want to add.

### credits

This will pick up the subtitle of your blog as the copyright owner. Change it if you like.
